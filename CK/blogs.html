                                        <h2>Thriving Presence</h2>
                                        <p style=" text-align: justify; margin-left: 30px; margin-bottom: 10px;">
                                            Presence is a mystery I desire and deliberately strive to live: I invite each person to live each moment. This is why!

                                            Presence goes beyond "being physically there, in a place". It goes to the whole of our being in a space and place, 
                                            sometimes not physically visible. The way to describe it might not be clear or quantifiable, the effects/impact is far reaching.

                                            A fully present being is non-judgemental, all accepting, filling the space with a "nothing else matters more than you" kind of 
                                            a world even when the room is filled with a thousand people. Yet, each person in that room feel valued, loved, respected, cared 
                                            for , connected spontaneously.

                                            As a person and a coach, I see the presence of a coach, (in the whole being) and as described by ICF through the 8 Coaching Competencies.

                                            Its a presence that brings feelings of safety for both, facilitating healing, new insights, embracing of different components of the person
                                             of the client, growth, actions, celebrations, vulnerabilities, opportunities and possibilities in a space of safety and ownership and accountability.

                                            Presence has potential to make one feel so safe, such that they can empty themselves in all ways they choose to and feel alright about it. They can 
                                            embrace their most vulnerable portions and melt them into their biggest strengths
                                        </p>
                                        <p style=" text-align: justify; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 35px;margin-bottom: 10px;">
                                            This is what I bring into coaching, an invite to a presence that invites the clients too to be present in and for themselves:
                                        </p>
                                        <p style=" text-align: justify; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 35px;margin-bottom: 10px;">
                                            So, like the SUNFLOWER: whose beautifully amazing presence beckons us towards their beauty, standing tall and bright and following 
                                            the direction of the sun.... I invite you to walk in the direction your light within leads you........

                                            “I see you are becoming a Mini-Monk and probably getting ready to sell your Ferrari”. I responded to my daughter's WhatsApp text. 
                                            By this point, I was chuckling, amused at how quickly everything had happened. Robin Sharma, for example, is one of my favorite 
                                            authors and speakers. "The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari" was the first book by him that I read and couldn't put down for hours, I still
                                             refer to it for insights. For me, one of the most poignant stories of all time.

                                            Today is an off-duty day for me; generally, when I'm off duty, I find it difficult to stay away from my Life Bloom CEO role. However, I'm resolved
                                             to write my blog this morning. I have a lot of ideas, but this SMS from my daughter is causing a shift in my mind.

                                            Presence, the Mystery of our Presence, and the blessings it brings forth if well lived, have been a source of fascination for me. Since mid-2021, 
                                            I've been increasingly intrigued about what Presence can be and how to enhance my offering to the world through it: I've been reading and attending

                                            Julian, the main character in the fable “The Monk who Sold His Ferrari” , associated himself with his very successful legal firm, high-end lifestyle, 
                                            and his Ferrari before a life -changing experience led him in the journey to becoming a Monk. He decided to leave his practice and sell his Ferrari in 
                                            order to focus on discovering or investigating himself, his beauty, his uniqueness and his gifts for the world. How was becoming a Monk going to bring
                                             Julian’s presence in the world in a different, more worthwhile way? And it did, and the profound lessons from this fable are part of my guiding light 
                                             on this path.

                                            I identify with the tale; I've identified with a number of things in the past that I've considered to be a means of identifying myself, my presence. 
                                            Education, marriage, job title, pay, automobile, and other people's recognition of me are at the top of the priority list. Until…recently.

                                            I began to concentrate more consciously and intentionally... I began the process of selling the equivalent of my "Ferraris" in the same way that the 
                                            Monk did. Unlike the Monk, who sold his Ferrari in complete piece and instantly, I am deconstructing and selling portions and components of my many 
                                            “Ferraris”. Most likely, it's to keep me safe. In this way, I aim to progressively embody Eckhard Tolle's lesson, which my daughter conveyed with me 
                                            this morning, of ceasing to define myself. Because it is restricting, limiting, just often outwardly fulfilling. (I know it, I am making steps,
                                             I am a work in progress)

                                            Therefore, I am more intent on creating my song as I sing it, according to my Creator's will. I invite you to reflect on E. Tolle words of encouragement 
                                            to you and me:

                                            “Give up defining yourself to yourself or to others. You won't die, you will come to life. And don’t be concerned with how others define you. When they 
                                            define you, they are limiting themselves, so it is their problem. Whenever you interact with other people, don’t be there primarily as a function or a 
                                            role, but as a field of conscious Presence. You can only lose something you have, but you cannot lose something that you are” ECKHART TOLLE.
